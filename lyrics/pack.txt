you will go on a journey
you will bring all you need
you need only yourself
you will pack what you need

theres a tremor in the ground
a vibration in your heart
the sky flickers
yet you are calm

you are lucid
below the surface
there is a dense fog
but, you can see very clearly

you are a rock
the world dances
there is harmony in the noise
you will pack what you need
#you have packed what you need
