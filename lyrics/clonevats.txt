Greetings.
As you might know, my designation is Zrryt, the Apex-Genome Navigator aboard the starship Lexical Libation.
Alas, you won'tfind another hyperrat in our quadrant with deeper knowledge in quantum genetic dynamics and cryonic biocoding.
Otherwise known as the fascinating, mind-bending realm of cloning.
Passage through my domain, the clone vats, is like wading through the viscous soup of life itself.
Each vat, a microcosm of pulsating potentiality, churning with deoxyribonucleic acid - or DNA, for the  novices amongst you.
Each helix twist, double-cross armed with genetic data that sculpts species.
Yes, I control this vital symphony of genes, reading the melodies of life, encoded in adenine, guanine,cytosine, and thymine.
In my lab, we don't follow Mendel's outdated peasantry path.
No! We plunge our paws into the heart of molecules, manipulating amino acids and exons.
Shaping genomes, our mutable dance of existence, into the finest starship crew this side of the Cygnus Arm.
But don't misinterpret my excitement for lax oversight.
Stray from the divine drafting of our GenoSequencers, initialize an erroneous chromosomal cross-hatch, and it's a one-way transwarp trip to a genetic monstrosity.
Safety first, as those bumbling humanoids might say.
You ask me, why clones?
Well, imagine having an entire crew burdened by neither fatigue nor individual desires, but instead, driven by the single, collective purpose of exploration.
No complications, only the finest specimens cloned to perfection, each being biologically designed to function optimally for their respective roles.
Many humans whine, they're increasingly of the opinion that theyâ€™d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.
And some say that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should  ever have left the oceans.
But thats only for the snotty spoilt humans, we rats manage just fine!
We build, explore, adapt at an ever increacing pace!
And with this techno backing track, we will do just that!
