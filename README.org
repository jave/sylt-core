* About Sylt-core

Sylt core is a refactor of my other Overtone repo, Sylt.

So sylt-core is just the Overtone parts, and the collab parts will
remain in Sylt.

The refactor made it way easier for me to use Overtone on a plane. I
have a personal challenge to be able to have fun with a computer with
no internet.
